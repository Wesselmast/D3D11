TODO:

- Multiple lights
- Skeletal animation
- Particle system
- Outline effect for selected objects

Math:
- WorldToScreen conversion and vice versa
- RayToScreen function to allow selecting objects with the mouse for both gameplay and for editing.

Login System:
- Try out a database that isn't localhost
- Fix the login system to link score to the password and username (no duplication!)
