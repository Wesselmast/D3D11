TODO:

Rendering:

- Outline effect for selected objects

Math:
- WorldToScreen conversion and vice versa
- RayToScreen function to allow selecting objects with the mouse for both gameplay and for editing.

Login System:
- Transfer SQL server to the actual server computer
- Make sure two users cannot be logged in at the same time

Game:
- Adding models:
  - Cactus
  - Saloon
  - Wagon
  - Haybales
