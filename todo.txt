hshTODO:
- Shadows
- Fullscreen support
- Networking (Nonblocking sockets)
- Demo level should be there as soon as possible!
- Fix up viewports : ~
- Selecting objects should be done on the mouse pointer, not the middle of the screen
- Add world to screen coordinates and vice versa



PROBLEM:
- Resizing or moving the window causes the game to freeze, crashing the networking size of things
