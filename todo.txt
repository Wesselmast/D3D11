TODO:

Rendering:
- Fix up viewports, it's still not possible to resize the window
- Shadows
- 2D rendering. This should also get its own rendering pool (I think??)
- PBR
- Multiple lights
- Skeletal animation
- Particle system
- Outline effect for selected objects

Math:
- The bounds check is definately not right yet (looks like a scale issue?)
- There should probably be some way to wireframe-represent the colliders

Login System:
- Make sure two users cannot be logged in at the same time on the same account

Networking:
- Fix networking so that it works without delay for 4 players instead of just 2
- Show bullets over the network

Game:
- Adding models:
  - Saloon
  - Wagon
  - Haybales
  - Dry grass
- Adding gameplay:
  - Drawing a 2d reticle at the mouse position

Other:
- Add a brush for painting foliage, could be pretty fancy B)
