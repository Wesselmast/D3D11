hshTODO:
- Shadows
- Demo level should be there as soon as possible!
- Fix up viewports : ~
- Selecting objects should be done on the mouse pointer, not the middle of the screen
- Add world to screen coordinates and vice versa
- Connect a database and add a login system for players
- 2D rendering. This should also get its own rendering pool (I think)


PROBLEM:
- Only two players can play simultaniously at the moment
