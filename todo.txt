TODO:
- Shadows
- Fullscreen support
- Networking (Nonblocking sockets)
- Demo level should be there as soon as possible!
- Fix up viewports : ~
- Selecting objects should be done on the mouse pointer, not the middle of the screen
- Add world to screen coordinates and vice versa


NEW STUFF:
- I can now allocate with the memory arena
  - Change model loading to work with memory arena
  - Change save/load system to work with memory arena (no more path saving!)

I NEED TO FIX THE ABOVE ASAP. Save/Load is currently borked
